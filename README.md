# Sparkle-Website

A Website for the model Sparkle

### Technologies Used

I intial used HTML and CSS but I am in the middle of transfering it to React. I used npm package router to link to other components

### User Story
1. Site will have links to other pictures.
2. Site will have a gallery to display images.
3. Site will be able to swipe to see rest of images.

### Unsolved Problems

1. Responsiveness still needs work.
2. Have to link the rest of the pages through router.
3. Have to upload the rest of images as soon as model sends them to me.
4. Have to make site progresive.
5. need to fix the display of the images.
